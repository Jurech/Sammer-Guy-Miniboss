; =============================== FLEXGLOW ENGINE MADE BY BLACK_FALCON v1.1 ===============================
;
;	v1.1 changelog
;	- fixed a bug where the timers wouldn't get reset when changing rooms, causing them to mess things up
;	  this was fixed by changing the used RAM to that reserved for enemy 0x1F (the 32nd enemy in the room)
;	  because all enemy RAM is initialized to 0000 when entering a room
;	  so unless you're as fancy as to use 32 enemies in a single room, it should work
;	- also very minor improvements were done here and there, without changing the location of the offsets

; What this does:
; With this engine you can set up glows whereever you want.
; 	The engine:
;		- lets you choose whatever and how much palette bits to glow
;		- can make things glow red/blue/green or any combination of these three
;		- allows you to set different timers for each glow
;		- can make the chosen colors circle forwards or backwards
;		- lets you choose how intense the glow should be
;		- can handle a maximum of 16 glows per room (I *think* that should be enough for now...)

; Tables are located below the code (also see 'Palette Table.png' and keep it handy, it'll help understanding the format)
; if you still need help, feel free to contact me (don't expect a fast answer, though)

; ============================================= [TABLES] ============================================= 

;									 -------- TABLE FORMAT --------


; the table consists of a number for how many glows to process, followed by the glow setup, which takes 7 bytes per glow.
; Format:

; [XX]											;
; [TT] [MM] [00] [PP] [NN] [CC] [GG]			;first glow
; [TT] [MM] [00] [PP] [NN] [CC] [GG]			;second glow etc.
; ..

; X - number of glows per setup (max of 15 per room)
; T - Timer: 
;		- defines number of frames to wait for the next gradient to process (max. of 0xFF (255 frames))
; M - Mode: 
;		- lets you choose what to do with the palette bits
;		- Possible modes are:
;						00 = add color first, then subtract again
;						01 = subract color first, then add again
;						02 = cycle forwards through the palettes chosen (only makes sense with 2 or more palettes bits chosen)
;						03 = cycle backwards through the palettes chosen (only makes sense with 2 or more palettes bits chosen)
; 00 - always 00, don't change it!																	
; P - Palette bit address:
;		- this is where "Palette Table.png" comes in handy!
;		  Each palette bit in Super Metroid has a certain address (Palette line and palette row, which you can determine using the table picture.
;
; N - Number of palette bits to process, this affects the palette bits that are following right after the address
; C - (ignored if M is 02 or 03) Color to use for addition/subtraction, in bits.
;		- 01 is red, 02 is green, 04 is blue, 
;		- adding these numbers together results in the colors being added ingame
;		- example: 01 (red) + 02 (green) = 03 (yellow)
;		- up to 07 (white)
; G - (ignored if M is 02 or 03) Number of gradients to process, basically how often you want to add/subtract a color before reversing the process
;	  total time for one glow period =  2 * G * T (for M being either 00 or 01)
